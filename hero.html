<h1> Johann Sebastian Bach </h1>
  
<img src="images/bachoo.jpg" width="400"/>


<p> Bach was born March 21, 1685 in Eisenach, Thuringiaa, Germany. He was one of the most influential composers of the Baroque era. He was well known in his earlier days for being an expert when it comes to constructing organs. 


<p> Some of his most important songs include his Four Orchestral Suites, Cantata No.21, and many, many more. I personally enjoy his cello suites and all of their movements.
